    "# **Session 4 – Functions and Integrated Project**\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Introduction**\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome back to the **Python for Finance Workshop**!\n",
    "\n",
    "Over the first three sessions, we have been carefully building the foundations that will allow us to use Python as a serious tool for economics and finance. In Session 0, we focused on getting everything ready: installing Anaconda, opening Jupyter Notebooks, and understanding how the workshop is organised. In Session 1, we turned Python into our “smart calculator” and started using it to compute quantities such as the future value of an investment. In Session 2, we learned how to control the flow of our programs with conditionals and loops. In Session 3, we introduced lists and dictionaries, which allow us to store and organise collections of data in a clear and flexible way.\n",
    "\n",
    "Today, we will take another important step towards writing real programs. Up to now, whenever we wanted to perform a calculation, we wrote the necessary lines of code directly in the notebook. If we needed the same calculation several times, we often copied and pasted the same code. This is fine for very small scripts, but it quickly becomes messy and hard to maintain.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this session, we will learn how to bundle a sequence of instructions into a **function**. A function is like a custom tool that we design ourselves: it has a name, it receives inputs, performs a calculation, and (usually) gives us a result. Once we define a function, we can reuse it as many times as we wish, with different values, without having to rewrite the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "To check that you really understand everything we have done so far, the second half of the session will be dedicated to a **larger project**. In this integrated exercise, you will combine variables, conditionals, loops, lists, dictionaries, and functions to build a small but meaningful Python program in a finance context.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Recap of the Previous Session**\n",
    "\n",
    "In **Session 3**, we focused on **data structures**, with an emphasis on lists and dictionaries. These structures are essential because real-world economic and financial problems rarely involve just a single number; they involve **collections** of values.\n",
    "\n",
    "More concretely:\n",
    "\n",
    "- We introduced **lists** as ordered sequences of items. We saw how to:\n",
    "  - Create lists, for example a list of annual returns or a list of asset tickers.  \n",
    "  - Access elements by their index (position in the list).  \n",
    "  - Modify lists by adding and removing elements.  \n",
    "  - Loop over a list to process all elements, for example to compute the total or the maximum of a set of values.\n",
    "\n",
    "- We then studied **dictionaries**, which store information in **key–value pairs**. This is very natural in finance and economics, because we often have “labels” attached to numbers. For instance, we:\n",
    "  - Mapped country names to their GDP values.  \n",
    "  - Mapped currency codes to exchange rates.  \n",
    "  - Mapped asset names to their expected returns or risk measures.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- We learned how to iterate over `.keys()`, `.values()` and `.items()` to process dictionaries, for example to find the country with the highest GDP or the asset with the highest return.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of Session 3, you could already write programs that store and process quite rich datasets. However, the code for these operations often remained “flat”: long blocks of instructions written one after the other. In Session 4, we will start to **structure** these blocks into named pieces—functions—that we can reuse and combine more easily.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **What We Will Learn in This Session**\n",
    "\n",
    "The main goal of this session is to understand how to use **functions** to organise our code and to reuse important calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of Session 4, you should be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Explain what a function is in Python and why functions are useful for writing clear, reusable programs.  \n",
    "- Define your own functions using the `def` keyword, specify **parameters** (inputs), and use `return` to send back results.  \n",
    "- Distinguish between functions that **return** a value and functions that primarily **perform an action** (such as printing output).  \n",
    "- Write functions that implement common financial formulas, such as simple interest, compound interest, return on investment (ROI), and compound annual growth rate (CAGR).  \n",
    "- Combine functions with the tools from previous sessions (variables, conditionals, loops, lists, and dictionaries) to perform more complex analyses.  \n",
    "- Work on a larger, finance-motivated **integrated project** (a simple portfolio analyser) that serves as a checkpoint for everything you have learned so far.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conceptually, this session marks another important shift in the way we think about programming. In Session 2, we moved from “What is the value of this expression?” to “What sequence of steps should the computer follow to solve this problem?”. In Session 4, we go one step further and start asking:\n",
    "\n",
    "> “Which pieces of this solution should become **reusable tools** that I can give names to and call whenever I need them?”\n",
    "\n",
    "This idea of building your own tools, your own functions, is at the heart of writing scalable and maintainable code, and it will be crucial for everything we do in the rest of the workshop.\n"

    "\n",
    "- It has a **name**, like `future_value` or `portfolio_return`.  \n",
    "- It receives **inputs**, such as an initial investment, an interest rate, or asset weights.  \n",
    "- It performs a sequence of **instructions** (the calculation).  \n",
    "- It usually **returns** a result, such as a future value or a rate of return.\n",
    "\n",
    "So far, we have used built-in functions such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `print(\"Portfolio value:\", value)` to display information,  \n",
    "- `len(returns)` to get the number of observations in a list of returns,  \n",
    "- `type(rate)` to check the data type of a variable.\n",

    "\n",
    "- **Avoid repetition**: instead of writing the same interest rate calculation five times, we write it once inside a function and call it whenever needed.  \n",
    "- **Improve readability**: a line like `r = one_period_return(p0, p1)` is often easier to understand than the raw formula.  \n",
    "- **Organise complex problems**: we can solve a larger finance problem (for example, simulating a portfolio over 10 years) by breaking it into smaller functions (compute yearly return, update wealth, print report, etc.).  \n",
    "- **Make changes easily**: if we change our formula for return (for instance, to use log returns instead of simple returns), we only need to modify the function definition, not every line where the formula appears.\n",

This makes our programs shorter, clearer, and easier to maintain.\n",

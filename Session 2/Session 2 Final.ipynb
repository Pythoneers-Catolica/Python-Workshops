    "# **Session 2 - Conditionals and Loops**\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Introduction**\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome back to the **Python for Finance Workshop**!\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous sessions, we started building the foundations that will allow us to use Python as a powerful tool for economics and finance. In Session 0, we focused on getting everything ready: installing Anaconda, opening Jupyter Notebooks, and understanding how we will work throughout the workshop. In Session 1, we turned Python into our “smart calculator” and began to see how it can help us reason about financial problems in a clear and precise way.\n",
    "\n",
    "Today, we will go one step further: instead of just asking Python to evaluate expressions, we will learn how to tell Python how to make decisions and repeat calculations automatically. This is where our programs start to feel less like static calculations and more like real tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Recap of the Previous Session**\n",
    "\n",
    "In Session 1, we worked with some of the most important building blocks of any Python program:\n",
    "\n",
    "- We learned how to create and update variables, such as an investment amount, an interest rate, or a number of years.  \n",
    "- We used the main data types: integers and floats for numerical quantities, strings for text, and booleans to represent “True/False” statements.  \n",
    "- We used Python to perform arithmetic operations and to compute simple financial quantities, such as the future value of an investment with a fixed interest rate.  \n",
    "- We saw how to use the `print` function to display clear messages, and we used f-strings to combine text with the values of variables in a readable way.  \n",
    "- We introduced comparison operators like `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`, `==` and `!=` to compare numbers (for example, checking whether an expected return meets a target return) and to create boolean expressions that can be either `True` or `False`.  \n",
    "- We also used `input` to read values from the user and converted them to numbers using `int` and `float`, so that the user can interact with our programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "All of these ideas will remain important in every session of the workshop. In Session 2, we will take them and combine them into more structured programs that can react to different situations.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **What We Will Learn in This Session**\n",
    "\n",
    "The main goal of this session is to understand how to control the “flow” of a Python program: which lines of code are executed, in which order, and how often.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of Session 2, you should be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use `if`, `elif` and `else` to make decisions in your programs, so that different blocks of code run depending on conditions that are `True` or `False`.  \n",
    "- Combine comparison and logical operators (such as `and`, `or` and `not`) to express more complex conditions, for example when an investment is attractive only if the expected return is high and the risk is below a certain threshold.  \n",
    "- Write `for` loops that repeat a block of code a fixed number of times, using the `range` function to control how many iterations are performed. This will allow us to simulate processes that evolve year by year or month by month.  \n",
    "- Write `while` loops that repeat a block of code until a certain condition is no longer satisfied, for example until an investment reaches a target value or a savings account reaches a goal.  \n",
    "- Put all of this together in small, finance-motivated examples, such as projecting the value of an investment over time, checking a monthly budget, or calculating how long it takes to reach a savings target.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conceptually, this session marks an important shift: instead of thinking only in terms of “what is the value of this expression?”, we start thinking in terms of “what steps should the computer follow to solve this problem?”. This way of thinking is at the heart of programming, and it will be essential for everything we do in the rest of the workshop.\n"

    "## **Section 1 – Boolean Expressions: A Quick Recap**\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we introduce new concepts, it is useful to briefly revisit something that you already saw in Session 1: boolean expressions.\n",
    "\n",
    "A boolean expression is any expression that can be evaluated as either `True` or `False`. In Python, this corresponds to the boolean values `True` and `False` that we already encountered when comparing numbers or checking whether a condition holds.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some typical examples in an economics or finance context are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- “Is GDP growth higher than inflation?”  \n",
    "- “Does this investment meet my target return?”  \n",
    "- “Is this budget in surplus or in deficit?”  \n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, we translate these questions into expressions that use comparison operators:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `>` (greater than)  \n",
    "- `<` (less than)  \n",
    "- `>=` (greater than or equal to)  \n",
    "- `<=` (less than or equal to)  \n",
    "- `==` (equal to)  \n",
    "- `!=` (not equal to)\n",

    "## **Section 5 – Putting It All Together: A Simple Monthly Investment Simulation**\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we will combine the main ideas from this session into a single, coherent example. The goal is to build a small program that models a realistic personal finance scenario and uses input, variables, boolean expressions, if/elif/else, for loops or while loops, and formatted output.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Scenario**\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose someone contributes a fixed amount to an investment account every month. The account earns a fixed annual interest rate, compounded monthly. We want to simulate how the balance evolves month by month over a number of years, and we also want to check whether the balance reaches a target amount along the way. As soon as the balance reaches or exceeds the target, we will stop the simulation and report the result.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **What the program should do**\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Ask the user for:  \n",
    "   • monthly_contribution (in euros)  \n",
    "   • annual_interest_rate (in percent)  \n",
    "   • years (how long to simulate)  \n",
    "   • target_balance (a goal we would like to reach)\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Convert the annual interest rate to a monthly rate. A simple approach is:  \n",
    "   • monthly_rate = (1 + annual_rate)^(1/12) − 1, where annual_rate is the decimal form of the percentage.  \n",
    "   • For example, if the user enters 6, then annual_rate = 0.06 and monthly_rate = (1 + 0.06)^(1/12) − 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Initialize:  \n",
    "   • balance = 0  \n",
    "   • months = years × 12\n",
    "\n",
    "4) Loop through each month and update the balance using two steps:  \n",
    "   • Add the monthly contribution to the balance.  \n",
    "   • Apply interest for the month by multiplying the balance by (1 + monthly_rate).\n",
    "\n",
    "5) After updating the balance each month, check whether the balance has reached or exceeded the target:  \n",
    "   • If balance ≥ target_balance, print a message that the target was reached in this month and stop the loop early.\n",
    "\n",
    "6) If the loop ends without reaching the target, print a message showing the final balance after all months.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Why this matters**\n",
    "\n",
    "This example shows how the building blocks from earlier sections work together in a natural way:\n",
    "\n",
    "• Input and variables let us adapt the calculation to the user’s situation.  \n",
    "• Boolean expressions and if statements let us check whether the goal is reached.  \n",
    "• A for loop (or a while loop) lets us repeat the monthly update easily without copying and pasting code.  \n",
    "• Using a monthly interest rate demonstrates how to translate an annual rate into monthly compounding, which is a common task in finance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Optional extensions (for later)**\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to explore further after the basic version works:\n",
    "\n",
    "• Add a “status print” every 12 months to show the balance at the end of each year.  \n",
    "• Track the total amount contributed and the total interest earned separately (for example, interest_earned = balance − total_contributed).  \n",
    "• Allow the user to choose between a for loop over a fixed number of months and a while loop that stops when the target is reached, whichever comes first.  \n",
    "• Accept an optional extra_contribution for a “13th month” (a bonus) once per year and include it in the simulation.  \n",
    "• Add basic input validation (for example, if the user enters a negative monthly contribution, print a helpful message)."

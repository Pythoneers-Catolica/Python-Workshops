    "## 10. Investment Years Above Target (for Loop + Counters)\n",
    "\n",
    "You want to analyse an investment’s performance year by year.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ask the user for:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `years` (integer) – the number of years of data  \n",
    "- `target_return` (in %) – the return that you consider “good”  \n",
    "\n",
    "Then:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Convert `target_return` to decimal form.  \n",
    "2. Set a counter `good_years = 0`.  \n",
    "3. Use a `for` loop from year 1 to `years`:\n",
    "   - For each year, ask the user for that year’s return in % (it can be negative).  \n",
    "   - Convert it to decimal.  \n",
    "   - If the year’s return is **greater than or equal to** the target return, increase `good_years` by 1.\n",
    "4. After the loop, print:\n",
    "   - `\"Number of years with returns at or above target: X\"`  \n",
    "   - `\"Number of years below target: Y\"`\n",
    "\n",
    "   where `Y` is the remaining years.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Using an `if` / `elif` / `else` statement, print a short summary:\n",
    "   - If **more than half** of the years were at or above target: `\"Overall performance: good.\"`  \n",
    "   - If **exactly half** of the years were at or above target: `\"Overall performance: mixed.\"`  \n",
    "   - Otherwise: `\"Overall performance: weak.\"`"

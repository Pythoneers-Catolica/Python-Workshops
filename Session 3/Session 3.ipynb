    "# **Session 3 - Data Structures: Lists and Dictionaries**\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Introduction**\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome back to the **Python for Finance Workshop**!\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous sessions, we started building the foundations that will allow us to use Python as a practical tool for economics and finance. In Session 0, we focused on getting everything ready: installing Anaconda, opening Jupyter Notebooks, and understanding how we will work throughout the workshop. In Session 1, we turned Python into our “smart calculator” and began to see how it can help us reason about financial problems in a clear and precise way. In Session 2, we learned how to make our programs react to different situations and repeat calculations automatically, using conditionals and loops.\n",
    "\n",
    "Today, we will go one step further. Instead of working mainly with individual variables (one interest rate, one GDP value, one price), we will learn how to represent and manipulate **collections of values**: groups of prices, sets of countries, portfolios of assets, and sequences of time periods. This is where Python starts to feel less like a calculator and more like a real **data analysis tool**, capable of working with small datasets in a structured way.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Recap of the Previous Session**\n",
    "\n",
    "In Session 2, we focused on controlling the “flow” of our programs:\n",
    "\n",
    "- We used `if`, `elif` and `else` to make decisions, so that different blocks of code run depending on whether certain conditions are `True` or `False`.  \n",
    "- We combined comparison and logical operators (such as `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`, `==`, `!=`, `and`, `or` and `not`) to express more complex conditions, for example when an investment is attractive only if the return is high enough and the risk is below a certain threshold.  \n",
    "- We wrote `for` loops that repeat a block of code a fixed number of times, often using the `range` function to simulate processes that evolve year by year or month by month.  \n",
    "- We wrote `while` loops that repeat a block of code until a condition is no longer satisfied, such as an investment reaching a target value or a savings account reaching a goal.  \n",
    "- We combined these tools in small, finance-motivated examples, such as projecting the value of an investment over time, checking a monthly budget, or calculating how long it takes to reach a savings target.\n",
    "\n",
    "All of these ideas will remain important in every session of the workshop. In Session 3, we will reuse conditionals and, especially, `for` loops, but we will apply them to **groups of related values** instead of just single numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **What We Will Learn in This Session**\n",
    "\n",
    "The main goal of this session is to understand how to store and organise **multiple related values** using Python’s built-in data structures, and how to work with them in a systematic way.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of Session 3, you should be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Explain what a **data structure** is and why it is useful when working with financial and economic data.  \n",
    "- Create and use **lists** to store ordered collections of values, such as daily stock prices, quarterly GDP growth rates, or monthly savings.  \n",
    "- Access, update, and extend lists by:\n",
    "  - Referring to individual elements by their position (index),  \n",
    "  - Using functions such as `len` to obtain basic information about a list,  \n",
    "  - Using list methods to add or modify elements.  \n",
    "- Create and use **dictionaries** to store labeled data as key–value pairs.\n",
    "- Loop over lists and dictionaries to compute summary quantities, such as total portfolio value, average price, or total GDP across a group of countries.  \n",
    "- Begin to see how these basic structures relate to the way larger datasets are handled in libraries such as `pandas`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conceptually, this session marks another important shift: instead of thinking only in terms of “one variable = one number”, we start thinking in terms of **collections** of values and how to organise them. This way of thinking is essential for data analysis and will prepare us for working with more advanced tools later in the workshop.\n"

    "## **Section 1 - Why We Need Data Structures**\n",
    "\n",
    "Up to now, most of our programs have worked with just a few variables at a time: one interest rate, one GDP value, one price, and so on. This is fine for very small examples, but it quickly becomes overcomplicated when we want to work with **many** related values at once.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if we have several countries and we store each GDP in its own variable, we end up with something like:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `gdp_portugal`, `gdp_spain`, `gdp_germany`, `gdp_france`, …\n",
    "\n",
    "Every time we add or remove a country, we have to change our code by hand, and formulas for totals or averages become long and hard to maintain.\n",
    "\n",
    "To avoid this kind of situation, Python allows us to group related values into single objects that can contain many items at once. These objects are called **data structures**. Two of the most important built-in data structures are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **lists**, which store ordered collections of values,  \n",
    "- **dictionaries**, which store labeled values as key–value pairs.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the example below, we still use separate variables, but it should already suggest why we might want something more systematic when the number of values grows."

    "\n",
    "- We motivated the need for **data structures**: using many separate variables quickly becomes overcomplicated when we work with several related values (for example, the GDP of multiple countries or the prices of several stocks).\n",
    "\n",
    "- We introduced **lists** as ordered collections of values:\n",
    "  - created lists with square brackets `[...]`,\n",
    "  - accessed elements by index using zero-based indexing,\n",
    "  - used functions like `len` and `sum` to compute basic summaries,\n",
    "  - modified lists by updating elements and using `append` to add new values,\n",
    "  - used **slicing** to extract sublists (such as the first few days or the last few observations),\n",
    "  - combined lists with `for` loops to process each element in turn and to compute totals, averages, and cumulative values.\n",
    "\n",
    "- We combined **lists** with **conditionals**:\n",
    "  - used `in` and `not in` to check membership in a list,\n",
    "  - wrote `if` statements inside loops over lists to treat some elements differently,\n",
    "  - checked whether a list is empty before looping over it,\n",
    "  - compared two lists (for example, available vs requested tickers).\n",
    "\n",
    "- We introduced **dictionaries** as collections of key–value pairs:\n",
    "  - created dictionaries using curly braces `{}`,\n",
    "  - accessed and updated values using `dictionary[key]`,\n",
    "  - added new key–value pairs,\n",
    "  - used `in` with dictionaries to check whether a key is present,\n",
    "  - used the `get` method to access values safely when a key might be missing,\n",
    "  - looped over keys, values, and `(key, value)` pairs with `items`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- We combined lists and dictionaries:\n",
    "  - represented portfolios and groups of countries as **lists of dictionaries**,\n",
    "  - used loops to compute totals (such as total portfolio value or total GDP) and percentages (such as portfolio weights or GDP shares),\n",
    "  - saw that a dictionary can also have a **list as its value**, which is useful when we want to store several values (for example, recent prices) for each key.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conceptually, this session marked a shift from thinking in terms of “one variable = one number” to thinking in terms of **structured collections of data**.

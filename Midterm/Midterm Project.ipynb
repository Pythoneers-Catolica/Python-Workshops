    "Welcome back to the **Python for Finance Workshop**!\n",
    "\n",
    "In Sessions 0–4, you have built the main ingredients of programming in Python for finance: variables and basic data types (Session 1), conditionals and loops (Session 2), lists and dictionaries (Session 3), and functions (Session 4). You can now write small programs that read input from the user, store data in structured ways, perform repeated calculations, and organise logic into reusable functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this checkpoint project is to **put everything together** in a single mini-application: a simple **portfolio analyser**. In this notebook, you will design and implement a program that asks the user for information about a portfolio, stores that information in dictionaries, and uses functions to compute quantities such as the expected portfolio return and the projected future value over a chosen horizon.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you work through the exercises, focus not only on getting correct results, but also on writing code that is **clear, structured, and easy to reuse**, just as you would need to do in real-world financial analysis.\n",

    "\n",
    "By the end of this notebook, you should be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Ask the user for information about a portfolio (asset names, expected returns, and weights) and store this data in a **dictionary of dictionaries**.  \n",
    "- Use **loops** to process the portfolio (for example, to check that the weights add up to 100%).  \n",
    "- Write and use **functions** to:\n",
    "  - compute the expected portfolio return as a weighted average,  \n",
    "  - compute the future value of the portfolio using compound interest,  \n",
    "  - classify the portfolio into simple “risk categories” based on its expected return.  \n",
    "- Produce a clear **text report** summarising your results, using `print` and f-strings.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conceptually, this project is a checkpoint: instead of practising each concept separately, you will show that you can **put everything together** to build a small, finance-motivated tool.\n"

# Pythoneers Club · Introduction to Python Programming

Welcome to the **Pythoneers Club of Católica Lisbon** Python Workshop!  
This repository contains the **Jupyter Notebooks** for all workshop sessions. It is designed for both **self-study** and as a companion to live lectures.  

> Open to everyone — while hosted by the Pythoneers Club, this workshop welcomes all students.

## Contents

- **Session 0 — Setup & Orientation**  
  1. Installing Anaconda and VS Code.
  2. Introduction to Python.
  3. Why we use Python in finance and automation.
  4. What are Jupyter Notebooks.
  5. Your very first `print()` statement.

- **Session 1 — Variables, Data Types & Type Conversion**  
  1. Understanding variables and assignment.  
  2. Using the `print()` function.  
  3. Working with core data types: `int`, `float`, `str`, and `bool`.  
  4. Formatting text with **f-strings**.  
  5. Getting user input with `input()`.  
  6. Converting between types with `int()`, `float()`, `str()`, and `bool()`.  

- **Session 2 — Conditionals & Loops**  
  1. Revisiting boolean expressions (`True`/`False`) and comparison operators.  
  2. Making decisions with `if`, `elif`, and `else`.  
  3. Using `for` loops and the `range()` function to repeat calculations (year-by-year and month-by-month).  
  4. Using `while` loops to repeat calculations until a condition is met (e.g. investment doubling, savings goals).  
  5. Putting it all together in a simple monthly investment simulation.
 
- **Session 3 — Data Structures: Lists & Dictionaries
    Why data structures (scaling beyond single variables).
    Lists: create, index (incl. negatives), len/sum/min/max, slice; append; sort vs sorted.
    Looping lists; membership (in); empty-list check.
    Dictionaries: create, access/update, membership, get().
    Looping dicts (keys/values/items); portfolio value + weights.
    Optional: list-of-dicts, dict-of-lists; common errors (IndexError/KeyError); bridge to pandas.

- **Session 3 — Data Structures: Lists & Dictionaries**  
  1. Why data structures (scaling beyond single variables).  
  2. Lists: create, index (incl. negatives), slice.  
  3. List basics: `len`, `sum`, `min`, `max`; `append`; `sort()` vs `sorted()`.  
  4. Looping lists; membership with `in`; empty-list checks.  
  5. Dictionaries: create, access/update; membership; safe lookup with `get()`.  
  6. Looping dicts (`keys`, `values`, `items`); portfolio value & weights.

- *(More sessions will be added as the workshop progresses...)*

### Practice & Problem Sets

Each session includes a **Problem Set** located in the **same folder** as the notebook.  
Problem sets are **optional**, but **highly recommended** to strengthen your understanding through hands-on practice.

**Solutions** will be uploaded to this repository **before the following class**, so you can review and compare your approach.

## How to Use These Notebooks

1. **Install Anaconda** (includes Python, Jupyter, and essential libraries).  
2. **Install Visual Studio Code (VS Code)** with the Python and Jupyter extensions.  
3. **Download a notebook** (`.ipynb` file) from this repository.  
4. Open the notebook in VS Code or JupyterLab.  
5. Run each code cell with **Shift+Enter**.

## Why Python?

- **Beginner-friendly** yet powerful.  
- **Essential in Finance**: data analysis, risk modeling, automation, trading algorithms.  
- **Automation**: reports, data pipelines, connecting to APIs and databases.  
- **Scalable**: goes far beyond Excel/VBA limitations.  
- **Industry Standard**: widely used in finance, consulting, tech, and academia.
